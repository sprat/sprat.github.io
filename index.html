        <p>Here you can find my personal software projects. All of them are developed in
            <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, one of my favorite languages.</p>


        <h2>albumart</h2>

        <p><a href="http://bitbucket.org/sprat/albumart/">albumart</a> is a command-line album
          art downloader tool. This tool recursively scan the root folder of your music library
          in order to find audio files, extracts their metadata (ID tags, etc.) and downloads
          album cover art from some famous cover art web sites according to the metadata.</p>

        <p>This project is born because I was bored searching, downloading, renaming manually
          the cover art for my audio albums. And the free tools I used were quite frustrating,
          either the images were of bad quality or the tools could not download images in
          batches. So I decided to write one myself.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/42424/">project tracker</a> could
          be found at <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a>, a really
          nice project tracking tool that support my agile workflow. If you want to contribute
          to the project, you can fork it and send me a pull request.</p>

        <p>This project is under continuous integration: build results can be found
            <a href="https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/sprat/job/albumart/">here</a>.</p>
